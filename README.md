## Introduction
The Non-Invasive Glucometer project focuses on creating a device that can measure blood glucose levels without the need for blood samples. This technology aims to improve the quality of life for individuals with diabetes by providing a convenient and pain-free method of monitoring their blood glucose.

## Features
Non-Invasive Measurement
Uses optical/thermal/electromagnetic technology to measure glucose levels.
Painless and easy to use.
User-Friendly Interface
Mobile app integration for real-time monitoring.
Data visualization and historical data tracking.
Accurate and Reliable
High accuracy comparable to traditional glucometers.
Continuous monitoring capability.

## Installation
