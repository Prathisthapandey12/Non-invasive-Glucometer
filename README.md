## Introduction
The Non-Invasive Glucometer project focuses on creating a device that can measure blood glucose levels without the need for blood samples. This technology aims to improve the quality of life for individuals with diabetes by providing a convenient and pain-free method of monitoring their blood glucose.

## Features
Non-Invasive Measurement:

-Uses thermal technology to measure glucose levels.
-Painless and easy to use.
-User-Friendly Interface
-Mobile app integration for real-time monitoring.
-Data visualization and historical data tracking.
-Accurate and Reliable
-High accuracy comparable to traditional glucometers.
-Continuous monitoring capability.

## Installation
To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/Prathisthapandey12/Non-invasive-Glucometer.git
cd Non-invasive-Glucometer
Ensure you have c++ and other required software installed, then install the necessary packages.

## Usage

1.Device Setup
 - Connect the device to your mobile device using Bluetooth.

2.Running the Software
 - To start the software for the non-invasive glucometer, use the following command:
   g++ code.cpp
 - Follow the on-screen instructions to calibrate the device and start measuring glucose levels.

3.Mobile App
 - Install the bluetooth-mobile app from the App Store .
 - Pair your device with the app via Bluetooth.
